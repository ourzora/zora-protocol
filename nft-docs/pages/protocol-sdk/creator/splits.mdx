# Creating an 1155 with a split payout

[0xSplits](https://splits.org/) can be used to split the payout for 1155s among multiple recipients.
This is done by first creating a 0xSplit recipient contract at a deterministic address based on the recipient addresses
and the split percentages, and then creating the 1155 token with the 0xSplit recipient contract as the payout recipient.
Due to security limitations, this must be done in two separate transactions.
**Note: splits are not currently supported with Premints, and are only supported with onchain creation using `create1155()`.**

Here is an example using the [0xSplits SDK](https://docs.splits.org/sdk/splits-v1):

```ts twoslash [example.ts]
// @filename: config.ts
// [!include ~/snippets/protocol-sdk/create/config.ts]

// @filename: data.ts
// [!include ~/snippets/protocol-sdk/create/data.ts]

// @filename: example.ts
// ---cut---
// [!include ~/snippets/protocol-sdk/create/create1155WithSplits.ts]
```

```ts twoslash [data.ts]
// [!include ~/snippets/protocol-sdk/create/data.ts]
```

```ts twoslash [config.ts] filename="config.ts"
// [!include ~/snippets/protocol-sdk/create/config.ts]
```
