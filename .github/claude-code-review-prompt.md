**Important: Changeset Validation**
If this PR modifies contract code (_.sol files in packages/_/src/), please check:

1. Is there a changeset file in .changeset/ directory?
2. If contract code changed but no changeset exists, remind the author to add one using `pnpm changeset add --empty` and manually edit it
3. According to CLAUDE.md: "When updating contract code, make a changeset for the corresponding contract package"
