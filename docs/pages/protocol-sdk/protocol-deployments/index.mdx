# Protocol Deployments Package

`@zoralabs/protocol-deployments` is a typescript package that provides contract ABIs, deployed addresses,
and typescript types for the Zora contracts.
These bundled configs and ABIs can be used in conjunction with wagmi or viem to interact with the Zora contracts in
typescript.

### Installation

To add `@zoralabs/protocol-deployments` to your project, install the required package:

:::code-group

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @zoralabs/protocol-deployments
```

```bash [npm]
npm install @zoralabs/protocol-deployments
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @zoralabs/protocol-deployments
```

### Importing Contract ABIs

The package exports a set of contract ABIs for the Zora Protocol. These can be imported and used as follows:

```ts twoslash
import {
  protocolRewardsABI,
  zoraCreator1155FactoryImplABI,
} from "@zoralabs/protocol-deployments";
```

### Importing Contract Addresses

The package exports addresses each Zora contract is deployed to on each chain.

```ts twoslash
import {
  protocolRewardsAddress,
  zoraCreator1155FactoryImplAddress,
} from "@zoralabs/protocol-deployments";
import { zora } from "viem/chains";

// get addresses contracts are deployed on the Zora chain
const protocolRewardsAddressOnZora = protocolRewardsAddress[zora.id];
const zoraCreator1155FactoryImplAddressOnZora =
  zoraCreator1155FactoryImplAddress[zora.id];
```

### Usage with React wagmi Hooks

The bundled contract ABIs and addresses can be used in conjunction with [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) to interact with contracts in a typesafe manner
in React Apps with minimal code.

First, install `@tanstack/react-query` with `@zoralabs/protocol-deployments`:

:::code-group

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @zoralabs/protocol-deployments @tanstack/react-query
```

```bash [npm]
npm install @zoralabs/protocol-deployments @tanstack/react-query
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @zoralabs/protocol-deployments @tanstack/react-query
```

:::

wagmi hooks like [useReadContract](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useReadContract) and [useWriteContract](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useWriteContract) can be used in conjunction with the contract ABIs and addresses:

```tsx twoslash [index.tsx]
// [!include ~/snippets/protocol-deployments/wagmi/protocolRewards.tsx]
```

### Usage with viem

The bundled contract ABIs and addresses can be used in conjunction with [viem](https://viem.sh/) to interact with contracts in a typesafe manner
with minimal code:

:::code-group

```ts twoslash [index.tsx]
// @filename: config.ts
// [!include ~/snippets/protocol-deployments/viem/config.ts]

// @filename: example.ts
// ---cut---
// [!include ~/snippets/protocol-deployments/viem/protocolRewards.ts]
```

```ts twoslash [config.ts]
// [!include ~/snippets/protocol-deployments/viem/config.ts]
```
