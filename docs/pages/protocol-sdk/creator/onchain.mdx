# Create Onchain 1155 Contracts & Tokens

The Protocol SDK can be used to prepare transactions to create 1155 contracts and tokens, using the Creator Client.

### Setup/Create the Creator Client

Initialize a Creator Client with a chain id and `PublicClient`. The chain is used to determine the network to interact with.

```ts twoslash
import { createCreatorClient } from "@zoralabs/protocol-sdk";
import { createPublicClient, http, Chain } from 'viem';
import { zora } from "viem/chains";

const publicClient = createPublicClient({ 
  chain: zora as Chain, 
  transport: http() 
});

const creatorClient = createCreatorClient({ chainId: zora.id, publicClient });
```

### Creating a new 1155 contract and token with Secondary Markets

The function `create1155` is used to create a new 1155 contract and token. By default, the token will be created with the [ZoraTimedSaleStrategyMinter](https://github.com/ourzora/zora-protocol/blob/main/packages/erc20z/src/minter/ZoraTimedSaleStrategyImpl.sol)
as the minter, meaning that after the primary sale is complete, [a secondary market powered by Uniswap will begin.](https://support.zora.co/en/articles/2519873)
The `contract` argument needs to be contract creation parameters.  Calling this function prepares a parameters for a transaction
that creates an 1155 contract at the deterministic address based on those parameters, and a token on that contract.

### Configuring the backing ERC20 Token Name and Symbol for the 1155 Secondary Market

When leveraging the [secondary markets](https://support.zora.co/en/articles/2519873) feature, a backing ERC20 token is created with a name and symbol for each minted 1155.  
By default, the name is set by fetching the json from the `tokenMetadataURI`, and using the `name` property from the token metadata json, and the symbol is generated by converting the name into a 4 character symbol.  
Alternatively these can be manually set by configuring the `token.salesConfig.erc20Name` and `token.salesConfig.erc20Symbol` properties correspondingly:

### Creating a token on an existing 1155 contract

To create a token on an existing 1155 contract, the function `create1155OnExistingContract` must be called
with the 1155 contract address and the token creation parameters.

```ts twoslash [example.ts]
// @filename: config.ts
// [!include ~/snippets/protocol-sdk/create/config.ts]

// @filename: createNewContract.ts
// [!include ~/snippets/protocol-sdk/create/createNewContract.ts]

// @filename: example.ts
// ---cut---
// [!include ~/snippets/protocol-sdk/create/createNew1155Token.ts]
```

```ts twoslash [createNewContract.ts]
// @filename: config.ts
// [!include ~/snippets/protocol-sdk/create/config.ts]

// @filename: createNewContract.ts
// ---cut---
// [!include ~/snippets/protocol-sdk/create/createNewContract.ts]
```

```ts twoslash [config.ts] filename="config.ts"
// [!include ~/snippets/protocol-sdk/create/config.ts]
```

### Setting a price per token

A price per token can be optionally set to earn eth additional on the primary sale when each token is minted, by setting `token.salesConfig.pricePerToken`.  
If the `pricePerToken` is set to more than 0, there will be no `creatorReward` earned on the mint fee. If a pricePerToken is set to more than 0, then the token is setup with the [ZoraCreatorFixedPriceSaleStrategy](https://github.com/ourzora/zora-protocol/blob/main/packages/1155-contracts/src/minters/fixed-price/ZoraCreatorFixedPriceSaleStrategy.sol) as its minter.
This will also result in not being able to [leverage the onchain secondary market feature](https://support.zora.co/en/articles/2519873) for tokens minted using
this minter.
