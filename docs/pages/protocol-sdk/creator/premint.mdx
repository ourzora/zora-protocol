# Using the SDK to Gaslessly Create 1155 Contracts and Tokens, aka Premints

<Callout type="warning">
  Premint is in maintenance. Support will be sunset in early October 2024.
  
  Please refer to the [onchain 1155 minting guide](/protocol-sdk/creator/onchain) moving forward.

### Intro to Premints

The Zora Protocol allows creators to create 1155 contracts and tokens without needing to pay any gas or have eth in their wallet. This
is done by creating what's called a `Premint` - a signed intent to create and setup an 1155 contract and/or token.
It is then uploading it to an API, where it can be retrieved later to bring onchain and mint by an account willing to pay the gas to do so.  This can either be the first collector, or the
original creator of the Premint. The account that brings the Premint onchain will earn the first minter reward.

In order for the Premint to be discoverable in the Zora network, it must be signed by the creator's wallet and uploaded to the Zora Premint API.
Before the Premint is brought onchain, the creator of the Premint can sign a message to update or delete it.

### Creator Client for Premints

The Zora Protocol SDK encapsulates the complexity for creating, updating and deleting premints, by providing methods that handle
building the Premint to sign, signing the Premint, and submitting the Premint and signature to the Zora Premint API so it can be fetched later.

Premints can be collected using the Collect Client's [mint()](/protocol-sdk/collect/mint).

#### Setup the Creator Client

Initialize the Creator Client:

```ts twoslash
import { createCreatorClient } from "@zoralabs/protocol-sdk";
import { zora } from "viem/chains";

const creatorClient = createCreatorClient({ chain: zora });

// @noErrors
creatorClient.
//            ^|



```

### Creating a Premint

The function `createPremint` builds a new premint with sensible defaults, and provides methods to
sign and submit it to the Zora Premint API.

Just calling `createPremint` does not actually submit the premint to the API; it just builds the premint object and corresponding data to sign.

One of the items returned from `create` is `signAndSubmit` which must be called with a `WalletClient` to sign the premint and submit the premint and signature to the Zora Premint API.

// [!include ~/snippets/protocol-sdk/premint/config.ts]

// @filename: example.ts

// [!include ~/snippets/protocol-sdk/premint/createFull.ts]
```

```ts twoslash [config.ts]

```

### Signing and Submitting Premint using Wagmi

Sometimes it may be desirable to sign a premint with another library, and not using the sdk's `signAndSubmit` method.
For this case, the `createPremint`, `updatePremint`, and `deletePremint` functions return a `typedDataDefinition` which is the typed data definition for the premint and must be signed.
Once the signature has been obtained, it can be submitted to the Zora Premint API using the `submit` method:

```ts twoslash
// [!include ~/snippets/protocol-sdk/premint/createSignSeparately.tsx]
```

### Updating a Premint

**Before a Premint is brought onchain,** it can be updated by the original creator of that premint, by having that creator sign a message indicating the update.
This signature and updated premint is then submitted to the Zora Premint API and replaces the existing stored premint for the token
with the same uid.

:::code-group

```ts twoslash [example.ts]
// @filename: config.ts
// [!include ~/snippets/protocol-sdk/premint/config.ts]

// @filename: create.ts
// [!include ~/snippets/protocol-sdk/premint/create.ts]

// @filename: example.ts
// ---cut---
// [!include ~/snippets/protocol-sdk/premint/update.ts]
```

```ts twoslash [simpleCreate.ts]
// [!include ~/snippets/protocol-sdk/premint/create.ts]
```

```ts twoslash [config.ts]
// [!include ~/snippets/protocol-sdk/premint/config.ts]
```

:::

### Deleting a Premint

**Before a premint is brought onchain,** it can be deleted by the original creator of that premint, by having that creator sign a message indicating that
the premint should be deleted.
This signature and deleted premint is then submitted to the Zora Premint API and causes the API to no longer serve that premint.

:::code-group

```ts twoslash [example.ts]
// @filename: config.ts
// [!include ~/snippets/protocol-sdk/premint/config.ts]

// @filename: create.ts
// [!include ~/snippets/protocol-sdk/premint/create.ts]

// @filename: example.ts
// ---cut---
// [!include ~/snippets/protocol-sdk/premint/delete.ts]
```

```ts twoslash [create.ts]
// [!include ~/snippets/protocol-sdk/premint/create.ts]
```

```ts twoslash [config.ts]
// [!include ~/snippets/protocol-sdk/premint/config.ts]
```

### Earning Create Referral Rewards

To earn a create referral reward, pass in the `createReferral` argument when creating a Premint:

```ts twoslash
import { createCreatorClient } from "@zoralabs/protocol-sdk";
import { useAccount, useChainId, usePublicClient } from "wagmi";

const chainId = useChainId();
const publicClient = usePublicClient()!;
const { address } = useAccount();
const creatorAccount = address!;
// ---cut---
const creatorClient = createCreatorClient({ chainId, publicClient });

await creatorClient.createPremint({
  // collection info of contract to create. 
  contract: {
    contractAdmin: creatorAccount!,
    contractName: "Testing Contract",
    contractURI:
      "ipfs://bafkreiainxen4b4wz4ubylvbhons6rembxdet4a262nf2lziclqvv7au3e",
  },
  token: {
    tokenURI:
      "ipfs://bafkreice23maski3x52tsfqgxstx3kbiifnt5jotg3a5ynvve53c4soi2u",
    payoutRecipient: creatorAccount!,
    // create referral address will get the create referral reward // [!code hl]
    // when the token is minted. // [!code hl]
    createReferral: "0x5843c8d6007813de3D2313fC55F2Fa1Cbbc394A6", // [!code hl]
  },
});
```
