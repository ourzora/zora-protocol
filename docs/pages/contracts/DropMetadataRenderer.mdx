# Drop Metadata Renderer

##### Metadata rendering contract for NFTs with individual media assets

This contract is in charge of managing and rendering the metadata for Zora drops.
A drop is an NFT collection where all the NFTs have individual media assets. 

Whenever a `tokenURI` is called on an NFT contract it is forwarded to this contract to get metadata for a specific NFT.

View the source contract code [here](https://github.com/ourzora/zora-drops-contracts/blob/main/src/metadata/DropMetadataRenderer.sol) and the list of deployed contract addresses [here](https://github.com/ourzora/zora-drops-contracts/tree/main/deployments).

- `baseURI`: A common base path that all the assets share and can append the tokenId to the end to get the metadata for an NFT.
- `contractURI`: A resource for getting metadata for the contract. Follows the contract-level metadata format described [here](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/contract-level-metadata).
- `provenanceHash`: A hash that is used to prove that the order of the images and metadata was set pre-mint, and was not manipulated.
- `target`: The address of the NFT contract to get data for.

## updateMetadataBase

)
```

## updateMetadataBaseWithDetails
Updates the metadata base URI, extension, contract URI and freezing details.

```
function updateMetadataBaseWithDetails(
    address target,
    string memory metadataBase,
    string memory metadataExtension,
    string memory newContractURI,
    uint256 freezeAt
)
```

## updateProvenanceHash
Updates the provenance hash stored in the contract. 
```
function updateProvenanceHash(address target, bytes32 provenanceHash)
```
