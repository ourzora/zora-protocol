# Coins Changelog


## 2.2.1

### Patch Changes

- [c96e0c5e](https://github.com/ourzora/zora-protocol/commit/c96e0c5e): Fix bug where liquidity cannot be migrated if there is a position with 0 liquidity

## 2.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [adf98059](https://github.com/ourzora/zora-protocol/commit/adf98059): Adds platform referral and trade referral functionality to creator coins, and unifies the fee structure between content and creator coins with a simplified 1% total fee.

  **New Features:**

  - Platform referral and trade referral functionality for creator coins (previously only supported on content coins)
  - Unified fee structure: Both content and creator coins use identical 1% fee distribution

  **Fee Structure Changes:**

  **Before (Content Coins - 3% total fee):**
  | Recipient | % of Market Rewards | % of Total Fees |
  | --------------- | ------------------- | --------------- |
  | Creator | 50% | 33.33% |
  | Create Referral | 15% | 10% |
  | Trade Referral | 15% | 10% |
  | Doppler | 5% | 3.33% |
  | Protocol | 15% | 10% |
  | --------------- | ------------------- | --------------- |
  | LP Rewards | - | 33.33% |

  **Before (Creator Coins - 3% total fee):**
  | Recipient | % of Market Rewards | % of Total Fees |
  | --------------- | ------------------- | --------------- |
  | Creator | 50% | 33.33% |
  | Protocol | 50% | 33.33% |
  | --------------- | ------------------- | --------------- |
  | LP Rewards | - | 33.33% |

  **After (All Coins - 1% total fee):**
  | Recipient | % of Market Rewards | % of Total Fee |
  | ----------------- | ------------------- | -------------- |
  | Creator | 62.5% | 50% |
  | Platform Referral | 25% | 20% |
  | Trade Referral | 5% | 4% |
  | Doppler | 1.25% | 1% |
  | Protocol | 6.25% | 5% |
  | ----------------- | ------------------- | -------------- |
  | LP Rewards | - | 20% |

  **Implementation Changes:**

  - Consolidated reward logic into `CoinRewardsV4.distributeMarketRewards()`

  **Backwards Compatibility:**

  - Existing `CreatorCoinRewards` event is still emitted for backwards compatibility when rewards are distributed for a CreatorCoin
  - Additionally, when market rewards are distributed for a CreatorCoin, the same `CoinMarketRewardsV4` event that is already emitted for ContentCoins is now also emitted

## 2.1.2

### Patch Changes

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [dac72691](https://github.com/ourzora/zora-protocol/commit/dac72691): Remove Uniswap V3 support and refactor coin architecture

  **Removal of V3 Support:**

  - Removed support for creating coins based on Uniswap V3 - only V4 coins are supported
  - Default coin deployment now creates Uniswap V4 coins when no config is provided (previously created V3)
  - Removed V3-specific test files and utilities
  - Updated remaining tests to use V4 deployment methods
  - Removed V3 configuration functions and encoders
  - Added revert logic for V3 deployment attempts in factory deploy functions

  **Architecture Refactoring:**

  - Merged BaseCoinV4 functionality into BaseCoin.sol to consolidate Uniswap V4 integration
  - Combined ICoinV4 interface with ICoin interface to simplify the interface hierarchy
  - Updated ContentCoin and CreatorCoin to inherit directly from BaseCoin
  - Removed duplicate files: BaseCoinV4.sol and ICoinV4.sol
  - Updated all imports and references throughout the codebase
  - This is an internal refactoring that doesn't change external functionality

### Patch Changes

- [deb9175b](https://github.com/ourzora/zora-protocol/commit/deb9175b): Enforce 32 bytes for decoding trade referral address from hook data

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- [acb9ff94](https://github.com/ourzora/zora-protocol/commit/acb9ff94): Move ZoraFactoryImpl to 2-step ownable with same storage slots

  This change updates the factory contract to use Ownable2StepUpgradeable instead of OwnableUpgradeable. The change maintains storage slot compatibility while adding the two-step ownership transfer pattern for enhanced security.

  Key changes:

  - ZoraFactoryImpl now inherits from Ownable2StepUpgradeable
  - Adds pendingOwner() function
  - Requires acceptOwnership() call to complete ownership transfers
  - Maintains storage slot compatibility for upgrades

### Patch Changes

- [65d36dbb](https://github.com/ourzora/zora-protocol/commit/65d36dbb): Refactor coinv4 into basecoinv4 and content coin

  This refactoring splits the coinv4 implementation into a base coin contract and content coin contract for better modularity and separation of concerns.
