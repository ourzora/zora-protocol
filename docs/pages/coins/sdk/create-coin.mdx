### Creating Coins

The Coins SDK provides functions to create new coins on the Zora protocol.

### Overview

Creating a coin involves generating calldata through the SDK and sending a transaction that deploys the ERC20 with protocol integrations. Use the high‑level `createCoin` helper to send and wait for the tx, or the low‑level `createCoinCall` to get raw `to/data/value` for your own tx flow.

### Parameters

```ts
import { Address } from "viem";
import {
  CreateConstants,
  ContentCoinCurrency,
  StartingMarketCap,
} from "@zoralabs/coins-sdk";

type MetadataType = {
  type: "RAW_URI";
  uri: string; // e.g., an IPFS URI
};

type CreateCoinArgs = {
  creator: Address; // Creator address
  name: string; // Coin name (e.g., "My Awesome Coin")
  symbol: string; // Ticker (e.g., "MAC")
  metadata: MetadataType; // Metadata descriptor
  currency: ContentCoinCurrency; // CREATOR_COIN | CREATOR_COIN_OR_ZORA | ZORA | ETH
  chainId?: number; // Chain ID to deploy on (defaults to Base mainnet `8453`)
  startingMarketCap?: StartingMarketCap; // LOW | HIGH (defaults to LOW)
  platformReferrer?: Address; // Optional referral address
  additionalOwners?: Address[];
  payoutRecipientOverride?: Address;
  skipMetadataValidation?: boolean; // Skip URI validation (not recommended)
};
```

#### Metadata

- The `metadata.uri` should point to valid metadata as described in the [Metadata](/coins/contracts/metadata) section.
- You can use the [Metadata Builder](/coins/sdk/metadata-builder) to upload assets and produce a URI. Example:

```ts twoslash
import { Address } from "viem";
import {
  createMetadataBuilder,
  createZoraUploaderForCreator,
} from "@zoralabs/coins-sdk";

const creatorAddress = "0xYourAddress" as Address;

const { createMetadataParameters } = await createMetadataBuilder()
  .withName("Test ZORA Coin")
  .withSymbol("TZC")
  .withDescription("Test Description")
  .withImage(new File(["FILE"], "test.png", { type: "image/png" }))
  .upload(createZoraUploaderForCreator(creatorAddress));

// createMetadataParameters can be used to spread in the createCoin call to handle metadata (name, symbol, and uri)
```

#### Currency

```ts
enum ContentCoinCurrencies {
  CREATOR_COIN = "CREATOR_COIN",
  CREATOR_COIN_OR_ZORA = "CREATOR_COIN_OR_ZORA", // If no creator coin is deployed, use ZORA
  ZORA = "ZORA",
  ETH = "ETH",
}
```

Choose the denomination for the coin’s market. Note that `ZORA`, `CREATOR_COIN`, and `CREATOR_COIN_OR_ZORA` are not available on Base Sepolia.

#### Starting Market Cap

Starting market cap is the initial liquidity/market configuration for the coin. By default and for most coins on Zora, the starting market cap is `LOW`.
If the coin is from a known creator or brand it is recommended to use `HIGH` to prevent sniping in the initial market by setting a higher initial purchase price.

#### Chain ID

Provide the exact `chainId` you intend to deploy on (e.g., Base mainnet `8453`).

### Usage

#### High‑level: send transaction and wait for receipt

```ts twoslash
import {
  createCoin,
  CreateConstants,
  ContentCoinCurrency,
} from "@zoralabs/coins-sdk";
import {
  Hex,
  Address,
  createWalletClient,
  createPublicClient,
  http,
} from "viem";
import { base } from "viem/chains";

const publicClient = createPublicClient({
  chain: base,
  transport: http("<RPC_URL>"),
});

const walletClient = createWalletClient({
  account: "0x<YOUR_ACCOUNT>" as Hex,
  chain: base,
  transport: http("<RPC_URL>"),
});

const args = {
  creator: "0xYourAddress" as Address,
  name: "My Awesome Coin",
  symbol: "MAC",
  metadata: { type: "RAW_URI" as const, uri: "ipfs://bafy..." },
  currency: CreateConstants.ContentCoinCurrencies.ZORA,
  chainId: base.id,
  startingMarketCap: CreateConstants.StartingMarketCaps.LOW,
  platformReferrerAddress: "0xOptionalReferrer" as Address,
};

const result = await createCoin({
  call: args,
  walletClient,
  publicClient,
  options: {
    // account: optional override
    // skipValidateTransaction: false by default
  },
});

console.log("Transaction hash:", result.hash);
console.log("Coin address:", result.address);
console.log("Deployment details:", result.deployment);
console.log("Chain info:", result.chain);
```

#### Response Structure

The `createCoin` function returns an object with the following properties:

```ts
type CreateCoinResult = {
  hash: string; // Transaction hash
  receipt: TransactionReceipt; // Full transaction receipt from the blockchain
  address?: string; // Deployed coin contract address (extracted from logs)
  deployment?: {
    // Detailed deployment information from CoinCreatedV4 event
    coin: string; // Coin contract address
    creator: string; // Creator address
    poolAddress: string; // Uniswap pool address
    // ... additional deployment details
  };
  chain: Chain; // Chain object (e.g., base, baseSepolia)
};
```

**Key Fields:**

- `address`: The newly deployed coin's contract address - use this to interact with the coin
- `hash`: Transaction hash for tracking the deployment transaction
- `receipt`: Full transaction receipt containing all logs and events
- `deployment`: Complete deployment details parsed from the `CoinCreatedV4` event, including pool information
- `chain`: Chain configuration object for the network where the coin was deployed

#### Low‑level: integrate with WAGMI using a raw transaction

`createCoinCall` returns an object with transaction parameters and the predicted coin address:

```ts
type CreateCoinCallResponse = {
  calls: Array<{
    to: Address; // Target contract address (coin factory)
    data: Hex; // Encoded function call data
    value: bigint; // ETH value to send (typically 0n for coin creation)
  }>;
  predictedCoinAddress: Address; // Deterministic address where coin will be deployed
};
```

The `calls` array contains the transaction parameters that can be passed to your tx‑sending flow (e.g., WAGMI `useSendTransaction`). The `predictedCoinAddress` provides the coin's address before the transaction is sent, allowing immediate UI updates or address storage.

```tsx
import * as React from "react";
import { createCoinCall, CreateConstants } from "@zoralabs/coins-sdk";
import { Address } from "viem";
import { useSendTransaction } from "wagmi";
import { base } from "viem/chains";

function CreateCoinButton() {
  const { sendTransaction, status } = useSendTransaction();
  const [coinAddress, setCoinAddress] = React.useState<Address | null>(null);

  const handleCreate = async () => {
    const args = {
      creator: "0xYourAddress" as Address,
      name: "My Awesome Coin",
      symbol: "MAC",
      metadata: { type: "RAW_URI" as const, uri: "ipfs://bafy..." },
      currency: CreateConstants.ContentCoinCurrencies.ZORA,
      chainId: base.id,
      startingMarketCap: CreateConstants.StartingMarketCaps.LOW,
    };

    const { calls, predictedCoinAddress } = await createCoinCall(args);

    // Store predicted address immediately for UI updates
    setCoinAddress(predictedCoinAddress);
    console.log("Coin will be deployed at:", predictedCoinAddress);

    // Send transaction with the first call parameters
    sendTransaction({
      to: calls[0].to,
      data: calls[0].data,
      value: calls[0].value,
    });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button disabled={status === "pending"} onClick={handleCreate}>
        {status === "pending" ? "Creating..." : "Create Coin"}
      </button>
      {coinAddress && <p>Coin address: {coinAddress}</p>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Metadata Validation

By default, the SDK validates `metadata.uri` content. You can disable with `skipMetadataValidation: true` if you already ensured validity.

```ts
import { validateMetadataURIContent } from "@zoralabs/coins-sdk";

// Optional manual validation
await validateMetadataURIContent("ipfs://...");
```

### Getting Coin Address from Transaction Receipt

Once the transaction is confirmed, extract the deployed coin address from logs using `getCoinCreateFromLogs`.

This is already done for you in the high‑level `createCoin` function.

```ts
import { getCoinCreateFromLogs } from "@zoralabs/coins-sdk";

const coinDeployment = getCoinCreateFromLogs(receipt);
console.log("Deployed coin address:", coinDeployment?.coin);
```
