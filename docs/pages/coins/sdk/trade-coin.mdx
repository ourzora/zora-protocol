# Trading Coins

The Coins SDK provides functionality to buy and sell coins on the Zora protocol. This page details the trading functions, their parameters, and includes code examples to help you integrate trading into your application.

## Overview

Trading coins involves either buying or selling an existing coin through the Zora protocol. The SDK provides two main approaches:

1. **High-level functions**: Complete solutions that handle the entire trading process.
2. **Low-level functions**: Building blocks for more customized implementations.

## Trading Parameters

When trading coins, you'll work with the following parameter structure:

```ts twoslash
import { Address } from "viem";

type TradeParams = {
  direction: "sell" | "buy";  // The trade direction
  target: Address;            // The target coin contract address
  args: {
    recipient: Address;       // The recipient of the trade output
    orderSize: bigint;        // The size of the order
    minAmountOut?: bigint;    // Optional minimum amount to receive
    sqrtPriceLimitX96?: bigint; // Optional price limit for the trade
    tradeReferrer?: Address;  // Optional referrer address for the trade
  };
};
```

## Buying Coins

### Basic Buy

```ts twoslash
import { tradeCoin } from "@zoralabs/coins-sdk";
import { Address, createWalletClient, createPublicClient, http, parseEther, Hex } from "viem";
import { base } from "viem/chains";

// Set up viem clients
const publicClient = createPublicClient({
  chain: base,
  transport: http("<RPC_URL>"),
});

const walletClient = createWalletClient({
  account: "0x<YOUR_ACCOUNT>" as Hex,
  chain: base,
  transport: http("<RPC_URL>"),
});

// Define buy parameters
const buyParams = {
  direction: "buy" as const,
  target: "0xCoinContractAddress" as Address,
  args: {
    recipient: "0xYourAddress" as Address, // Where to receive the purchased coins
    orderSize: parseEther("0.1"), // Amount of ETH to spend
    minAmountOut: 0n, // Minimum amount of coins to receive (0 = no minimum)
    tradeReferrer: "0xOptionalReferrerAddress" as Address, // Optional
  }
};

// Execute the buy
async function buyCoin() {
  const result = await tradeCoin(buyParams, walletClient, publicClient);
  
  console.log("Transaction hash:", result.hash);
  console.log("Trade details:", result.trade);
  
  return result;
}
```

### Simulating a Buy

Before executing a buy, you can simulate it to check the expected output:

```ts twoslash
import { simulateBuy } from "@zoralabs/coins-sdk";
import { Address, parseEther, createPublicClient, http } from "viem";
import { base } from "viem/chains";

// Set up viem clients
const publicClient = createPublicClient({
  chain: base,
  transport: http("<RPC_URL>"),
});

async function simulateCoinBuy() {
  const simulation = await simulateBuy({
    target: "0xCoinContractAddress" as Address,
    requestedOrderSize: parseEther("0.1"),
    publicClient,
  });
  
  console.log("Actual order size:", simulation.orderSize);
  console.log("Expected output amount:", simulation.amountOut);
  
  return simulation;
}
```

## Selling Coins

```ts twoslash
import { tradeCoin } from "@zoralabs/coins-sdk";
import { Address, parseEther, Hex, createWalletClient, createPublicClient, http } from "viem";
import { base } from "viem/chains";

// Set up viem clients
const publicClient = createPublicClient({
  chain: base,
  transport: http("<RPC_URL>"),
});

const walletClient = createWalletClient({
  account: "0x<YOUR_ACCOUNT>" as Hex,
  chain: base,
  transport: http("<RPC_URL>"),
});

// Define sell parameters
const sellParams = {
  direction: "sell" as const,
  target: "0xCoinContractAddress" as Address,
  args: {
    recipient: "0xYourAddress" as Address, // Where to receive the ETH
    orderSize: parseEther("100"), // Amount of coins to sell
    minAmountOut: parseEther("0.05"), // Minimum ETH to receive
    tradeReferrer: "0xOptionalReferrerAddress" as Address, // Optional
  }
};

// Execute the sell
async function sellCoin() {
  const result = await tradeCoin(sellParams, walletClient, publicClient);
  
  console.log("Transaction hash:", result.hash);
  console.log("Trade details:", result.trade);
  
  return result;
}
```

## Using with WAGMI

If you're using WAGMI in your frontend application, you can use the lower-level `tradeCoinCall` function:

```typescript
import { tradeCoinCall } from "@zoralabs/coins-sdk";
import { useContractWrite, usePrepareContractWrite } from "wagmi";
import { Address, parseEther } from "viem";

// Define trade parameters
const tradeParams = {
  direction: "buy" as const,
  target: "0xCoinContractAddress" as Address,
  args: {
    recipient: "0xYourAddress" as Address,
    orderSize: parseEther("0.1"),
    minAmountOut: 0n,
    tradeReferrer: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000" as Address,
  }
};

// Create configuration for wagmi
const contractCallParams = tradeCoinCall(tradeParams);

// In your component
function BuyCoinComponent() {
  const { config } = usePrepareContractWrite({
    ...contractCallParams,
    value: tradeParams.direction === "buy" ? tradeParams.args.orderSize : 0n,
  });
  
  const { data, isLoading, isSuccess, write } = useContractWrite(config);
  
  return (
    <button disabled={!write || isLoading} onClick={() => write?.()}>
      {isLoading ? 'Buying...' : 'Buy Coin'}
    </button>
  );
}
```

## Reading Trade Events from Transaction Logs

After a trade is completed, you can extract the trade event details from the transaction receipt:

```ts twoslash
const receipt: any = null;

// ---- cut -----
import { getTradeFromLogs } from "@zoralabs/coins-sdk";

// Assuming you have a transaction receipt and know the direction
const tradeEvent = getTradeFromLogs(receipt, "buy"); // or "sell"

if (tradeEvent) {
  console.log("Trade size:", tradeEvent.orderSize);
  console.log("Trade recipient:", tradeEvent.recipient);
  // Access other trade event fields as needed
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Referrers**: Creating platforms on top of coins allows you to earn from both platform creation and trading fees on both the create and trade side. Make sure to include your addresses in these fields.

2. **Consider Slippage**: Always set a reasonable `minAmountOut` to protect against slippage in volatile markets.

3. **Simulation First**: If not using the high level API, make sure to simulate and return reasonable errors to the user. This is done for you if using the higher-level `trade` function.

4. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for failed trades.

5. **Gas Estimation**: Be aware that gas costs can vary, especially during network congestion.

6. **Price Limits**: For advanced trading, consider setting `sqrtPriceLimitX96` to control the maximum price impact of your trade.
