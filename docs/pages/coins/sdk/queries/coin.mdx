# Coin Queries

The Coins SDK provides several query functions to fetch information about specific coins. This page details the available coin query functions, their parameters, and includes usage examples.

## Available Queries

### getCoin

The `getCoin` function retrieves detailed information about a specific coin, including its metadata, market data, and creator information.

#### Parameters

```ts twoslash
type GetCoinParams = {
  address: string;   // The coin contract address
  chain?: number;    // Optional: The chain ID (defaults to Base: 8453)
};
```

#### Usage Example

```ts twoslash
// [!include ~/snippets/coins/queries/getCoin.ts]
```

#### Response Structure

The response includes a `data` object containing a `zora20Token` object with the following properties:

```ts twoslash
import { GetCoinResponse } from "@zoralabs/coins-sdk";

// The Zora20Token type is imported from the SDK's generated types.
// It includes detailed information about a specific coin, such as its metadata, market data, and creator information.
type Zora20Token = GetCoinResponse['zora20Token'];
//    ^?





//

```

### getCoins

The `getCoins` function retrieves information about multiple coins at once, useful for batch processing or displaying multiple coins.

#### Parameters

```ts twoslash
type GetCoinsParams = {
  coins: {
    collectionAddress: string;
    chainId: number;
  }[]
};
```

#### Usage Example

```ts twoslash
// [!include ~/snippets/coins/queries/getCoins.ts]
```

#### Response Structure

The response includes a `zora20Tokens` array containing objects with the same structure as the `zora20Token` object in the `getCoin` response.

### getCoinComments

The `getCoinComments` function retrieves comments associated with a specific coin, useful for displaying community engagement.

#### Parameters

```ts twoslash
type GetCoinCommentsParams = {
  address: string;    // The coin contract address
  chain?: number;     // Optional: The chain ID (defaults to Base: 8453)
  after?: string;     // Optional: Pagination cursor for fetching next page
  count?: number;     // Optional: Number of comments to return per page
};
```

#### Usage Example

```ts twoslash
// [!include ~/snippets/coins/queries/getCoinComments.ts]
```

#### Paginating Through All Comments

To fetch all comments for a coin, you can use pagination:

```ts twoslash
// [!include ~/snippets/coins/queries/getCoinCommentsPagination.ts]
```

#### Response Structure

The response includes a `comments` array and pagination information:


## Error Handling

All query functions follow the same error handling pattern. When an error occurs, the promise is rejected with an error object that includes details about what went wrong.

```ts twoslash
// [!include ~/snippets/coins/queries/queryErrors.ts]
```
