# Zora Coins Protocol

The Zora Coins Protocol is a way to participate in the new creator economyâ€”one where users trade on attention, creativity, and cultural momentum. Every post becomes an instantly tradeable cryptocurrency token, transforming social media content into a tradeable asset.

This is the first time creators earn across posts, creators, and the platform. **Open, free, and valuable.**

## How It Works

Every coin has a **backing currency** and trades through a dedicated Uniswap V4 pool that with a custom hook that:
- **Distributes rewards** to creators, referrers, and the protocol on every trade
- **Preserves liquidity** by locking 33% of trading fees as permanent pool depth
- **Converts fees** through multi-hop swaps to ensure all rewards are paid in ZORA
- **Deposits initial liquidity** using [Doppler protocol](https://www.doppler.lol/) for optimized multi-curve positioning

## How Coins Work

**Creator Coins are profile-level tokens on Zora** - each account has its own coin where the username becomes the ticker ($username).

### Creator Coins
- **One coin per profile** - Each creator gets a single coin representing their brand
- **Fixed supply** - 1 billion total per coin
- **50% to creator** - Automatically distributed over 5 years  
- **50% tradeable** - Instantly available on the open market
- **Earn from every trade** - Creators earn $ZORA from trade activity

### Content Coins  
- **Post-level tokens** - Every post becomes an instantly tradeable coin
- **Creator-backed** - Uses the creator's coin as backing currency
- **Instant creator allocation** - 10M tokens go directly to creators at launch
- **990M tradeable** - Available on the market immediately

| **Liquidity Pool** | 500M tokens | Available for trading immediately |
| **Creator Vesting** | 500M tokens | Linear vesting over 5 years |
| **Total Supply** | 1B tokens | Fixed maximum supply |

### ContentCoin Distribution  
| Allocation | Amount | Details |
|------------|--------|---------|
| **Liquidity Pool** | 990M tokens | Available for trading immediately |
| **Creator Reward** | 10M tokens | Instant allocation to creator |
