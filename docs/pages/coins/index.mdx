# Zora Coins Protocol

The Zora Coins Protocol is a way to participate in the new creator economy—one where users trade on attention, creativity, and cultural momentum. Every post becomes an instantly tradeable cryptocurrency token, transforming social media content into a tradeable asset.

This is the first time creators earn across posts, creators, and the platform. **Open, free, and valuable.**

## How It Works

Every coin has a **backing currency** and trades through a dedicated Uniswap V4 pool with a custom hook that:

- **Protects against sniping** with an [early launch fee](/coins/contracts/rewards#early-launch-fee) that decays from 99% to 1% over 10 seconds
- **Distributes rewards** to creators, referrers, and the protocol on every trade
- **Preserves liquidity** by locking 20% of trading fees as permanent pool depth
- **Converts fees** through multi-hop swaps to ensure all rewards are paid in ZORA
- **Deposits initial liquidity** using [Doppler protocol](https://www.doppler.lol/) for optimized multi-curve positioning

## How Coins Work

**Creator Coins are profile-level tokens on Zora** - each account has its own coin where the username becomes the ticker ($username).

### Creator Coins

- **One coin per profile** - Each creator gets a single coin representing their brand
- **Fixed supply** - 1 billion total per coin
- **50% to creator** - Automatically distributed over 5 years
- **50% tradeable** - Instantly available on the open market
- **Earn from every trade** - Creators earn $ZORA from trade activity

### Content Coins

- **Post-level tokens** - Every post becomes an instantly tradeable coin
- **Creator-backed** - Uses the creator's coin as backing currency
- **Instant creator allocation** - 10M tokens go directly to creators at launch
- **990M tradeable** - Available on the market immediately

## Token Supply Distribution

All coins have a **1 billion token supply** with different allocation strategies:

### CreatorCoin Distribution

| ------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Liquidity Pool**  | 500M tokens | Available for trading immediately |
| **Creator Vesting** | 500M tokens | Linear vesting over 5 years       |
| **Total Supply**    | 1B tokens   | Fixed maximum supply              |

### ContentCoin Distribution

| Allocation         | Amount      | Details                           |
| ------------------ | ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Liquidity Pool** | 990M tokens | Available for trading immediately |
| **Creator Reward** | 10M tokens  | Instant allocation to creator     |
| **Total Supply**   | 1B tokens   | Fixed maximum supply              |

> **Vesting Details**: Creator coins vest linearly over 5 years, meaning creators can claim their tokens gradually using the `claimVesting()` function.
