# Hook System

The Zora protocol uses specialized Uniswap V4 hooks to automatically manage pool interactions and reward distribution for different coin types.

## Overview

The hook system consists of two specialized hook contracts that inherit from `BaseZoraV4CoinHook`:

- **ContentCoinHook** - Automatically manages pools for Content Coins with full referral reward distribution
- **CreatorCoinHook** - Automatically manages pools for Creator Coins with simplified reward distribution

Both hooks automatically implement fee collection, currency conversion, and reward distribution on every swap transaction.

## Inheritance Structure

The hook system uses inheritance to share common functionality while allowing specialized reward distribution:

### BaseZoraV4CoinHook (Abstract Base)

Contains all core hook functionality shared between coin types:

**Automated Operations:**
- Pool initialization and automatic liquidity position creation
- Automatic fee collection from all LP positions on every swap
- Multi-hop currency conversion through optimal swap paths
- Hook upgrade and [migration support](/coins/contracts/liquidity-migration)
- Comprehensive event emission and transaction logging

**Technical Features:**
- Uniswap V4 `afterInitialize` and `afterSwap` hook permissions
- Doppler multi-curve liquidity positioning
- Trusted message sender validation
- Pool-to-coin mapping and position tracking

### ContentCoinHook (Inherits from Base)

Implements specialized reward distribution for Content Coins by overriding the `_distributeMarketRewards()` function:

- **Full referral rewards**: Both create referral (15%) and trade referral (15%)
- **Creator rewards**: 50% of market rewards
- **Doppler rewards**: 5% of market rewards
- **Protocol rewards**: Remaining percentage

### CreatorCoinHook (Inherits from Base) 

Implements simplified reward distribution for Creator Coins by overriding the `_distributeMarketRewards()` function:

- **Creator rewards**: 50% of market rewards
- **Protocol rewards**: 50% of market rewards
- **No referral or Doppler rewards**

**Key Insight**: The only difference between the two hooks is their reward distribution methodology - all other functionality (pool management, fee collection, currency conversion, [migration](/coins/contracts/liquidity-migration)) is identical and handled by the base contract.

## Deployment Addresses

import { ContractAddress } from '@components/ContractAddress'

| Chain | Chain ID | Hook Contract | Address |
|-------|----------|---------------|---------|
| Base  | 8453     | ContentCoinHook | <ContractAddress address="0x9ea932730A7787000042e34390B8E435dD839040" chain="base" /> |
| Base  | 8453     | CreatorCoinHook | <ContractAddress address="0xd61A675F8a0c67A73DC3B54FB7318B4D91409040" chain="base" /> |

## Hook Permissions

Both hooks have the following Uniswap V4 permissions:

```solidity
function getHookPermissions() external pure override returns (Hooks.Permissions memory) {
    return Hooks.Permissions({
        beforeInitialize: false,
        afterInitialize: true,      // ✅ Enabled
        beforeAddLiquidity: false,
        afterAddLiquidity: false,
        beforeRemoveLiquidity: false,
        afterRemoveLiquidity: false,
        beforeSwap: false,
        afterSwap: true,           // ✅ Enabled
        beforeDonate: false,
        afterDonate: false,
        beforeSwapReturnDelta: false,
        afterSwapReturnDelta: false,
        afterAddLiquidityReturnDelta: false,
        afterRemoveLiquidityReturnDelta: false
    });
}
```

## Core Functionality

### After Initialize Hook

When a new pool is initialized, the hooks automatically:

1. **Validate Pool Setup**: Ensure the pool is properly configured for the coin type
2. **Create Initial Positions**: Set up liquidity positions based on the coin's configuration
3. **Register Pool**: Link the pool to the appropriate coin contract
4. **Configure Reward Distribution**: Set up the reward distribution mechanism

### After Swap Hook

On every swap, the hooks automatically:

1. **Collect LP Fees**: Gather accrued fees from all liquidity positions
2. **Convert to Payout Currency**: Swap collected fees through optimal paths
3. **Distribute Rewards**: Allocate rewards based on coin type and configuration
4. **Emit Events**: Log detailed swap and reward information

## Reward Distribution

The hooks automatically implement different reward distribution logic for different coin types:

### Content Coins

**Total Fee Split**: 33.33% reminted as LP rewards, 66.67% distributed as market rewards

**Market Rewards Distribution**:
- **Creator**: 50% (5000 BPS)
- **Create Referral**: 15% (1500 BPS)
- **Trade Referral**: 15% (1500 BPS)  
- **Doppler**: 5% (500 BPS)
- **Protocol**: ~15% (remaining)

### Creator Coins

**Total Fee Split**: 33.33% reminted as LP rewards, 66.67% distributed as market rewards

**Market Rewards Distribution**:
- **Creator**: 50% (5000 BPS)
- **Protocol**: 50% (remaining)

*Note: Creator Coins do not have referral or Doppler rewards*

## Multi-Hop Reward Swapping

The hooks automatically support complex swap paths for coins that aren't directly paired with the final payout currency:

### Example: Content Coin → Creator Coin → ZORA

1. **Content Coin fees** automatically collected in Content Coin tokens
2. **First hop**: Content Coin → Creator Coin (backing currency)
3. **Second hop**: Creator Coin → ZORA token (final payout currency)
4. **Distribution**: ZORA tokens automatically distributed to reward recipients

This automatically enables complex token economies where Content Coins can be backed by Creator Coins, which are in turn backed by ZORA tokens.

## Liquidity Management

The hooks automatically manage liquidity positions throughout the pool lifecycle:

### Automatic Position Creation

During pool initialization, the hooks automatically create:

- **Discovery Positions**: Initial price discovery ranges
- **Market Positions**: Main trading ranges  
- **Multi-Position Support**: Complex liquidity curves with multiple ranges

### Position Structure

```solidity
struct LiquidityPosition {
    int24 tickLower;           // Lower price bound
    int24 tickUpper;           // Upper price bound
    uint128 liquidity;         // Liquidity amount
    uint256 feeGrowthInside0X128; // Fee tracking
    uint256 feeGrowthInside1X128; // Fee tracking
}
```

## Migration Support

The hooks automatically support controlled liquidity migration to enable upgrades to new hook versions while preserving all existing liquidity. 

**Migration Resources:**

## Events

### Swapped Event

```solidity
event Swapped(
    address indexed sender,
    address indexed swapSender,
    bool isTrustedSwapSenderAddress,
    PoolKey key,
    bytes32 indexed poolKeyHash,
    SwapParams params,
    int128 amount0,
    int128 amount1,
    bool isCoinBuy,
    bytes hookData,
    uint160 sqrtPriceX96
);
```

Emitted on every swap with detailed transaction information including:
- **sender**: The address that initiated the swap transaction
- **swapSender**: The original message sender (may differ from sender if using trusted message senders)
- **isTrustedSwapSenderAddress**: Whether the sender is registered as a trusted message sender
- **key**: The complete pool key identifying the pool
- **poolKeyHash**: Indexed hash of the pool key for efficient filtering
- **params**: The swap parameters (amount, direction, etc.)
- **amount0/amount1**: The actual token amounts exchanged
- **isCoinBuy**: Whether this swap is purchasing the coin (true) or selling it (false)
- **hookData**: Additional data passed to the hook (often contains referral information)
- **sqrtPriceX96**: The final sqrt price after the swap

### CoinMarketRewardsV4 Event

```solidity
event CoinMarketRewardsV4(
    address coin,
    address currency,
    address payoutRecipient,
    address platformReferrer,
    address tradeReferrer,
    address protocolRewardRecipient,
    address dopplerRecipient,
    MarketRewardsV4 marketRewards
);
```

Emitted when market rewards are distributed from collected fees, showing exact amounts to each recipient:
- **coin**: The coin contract that generated the rewards
- **currency**: The currency in which rewards are paid out
- **payoutRecipient**: The creator's reward recipient address
- **platformReferrer**: Address receiving platform referral rewards (Content Coins only)
- **tradeReferrer**: Address receiving trade referral rewards (Content Coins only)
- **protocolRewardRecipient**: Protocol treasury address
- **dopplerRecipient**: Doppler rewards recipient (Content Coins only)
- **marketRewards**: Detailed breakdown of reward amounts for each recipient

### LpReward Event

```solidity
event LpReward(
    address indexed coin,
    address indexed currency,
    uint256 amountCurrency,
    int24 tick,
    uint128 liquidity
);
```

Emitted when liquidity provider rewards are reminted back into the pool:
- **coin**: The coin contract generating the LP rewards
- **currency**: The currency of the reminted LP position
- **amountCurrency**: The amount of currency reminted as new liquidity
- **tick**: The current pool tick when the reward was reminted
- **liquidity**: The amount of liquidity reminted back into the pool

This event tracks the 33.33% portion of collected fees that are automatically reminted as liquidity rather than distributed as market rewards.
