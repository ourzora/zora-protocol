# Coin Rewards

## Introduction

At Zora, we are passionate about providing the best experience to create and earn onchain.
**Coin Rewards** is a split of the Zora fee allowing:

- Creators to monetize their work
- Developers to earn from facilitating coin creation and trading

## Coin Trading Rewards (V4)

Coin trading rewards are distributed to the creator, create referral, trade referral, protocol, and doppler.

<Callout type="success">
All coins created on the Zora app including web and mobile after June 6th 2025 use the V4 configuration.
</Callout>

The latest V4 coins use a UniswapV4 hook to collect fees, swap to a backing currency, and distribute rewards to recipients on every swap.

## How V4 Rewards Work

V4 coins generate rewards through a sophisticated automated system that operates on every swap:

### Fee Collection and Distribution

When users trade coins, the Uniswap V4 hook automatically:

1. **Collects LP fees** (1% total fees for v2.2.0+) from all liquidity positions
2. **Splits fees** into two parts:
   - **20% for LP Rewards** - Used to create new liquidity positions  
   - **80% for Market Rewards** - Distributed to stakeholders

### LP Reward Mechanism: Liquidity Preservation

The 20% allocated to LP rewards doesn't go to liquidity providers directly. Instead, it's used to **mint new single-sided liquidity positions** that are strategically placed outside the current trading range:

- **Token0 fees** → New position created **above** current price (inactive until price moves up)
- **Token1 fees** → New position created **below** current price (inactive until price moves down)

These positions are essentially **locked and burned** - they don't earn future fees but serve a crucial purpose: **maintaining pool liquidity**. Instead of extracting 20% of fees from the pool, this mechanism keeps them as permanent liquidity, ensuring the pool becomes deeper and more liquid over time.

### Market Reward Distribution

The remaining portion of collected fees becomes "market rewards" and is distributed to stakeholders.

### V4 Market Reward Distribution (Current - Since 2.2.0)

<Callout type="info">
As of version 2.2.0, the fee structure has been unified with a total fee of 1% on pools (was 3% previously) and consistent distribution across both coin types.
All coins with hooks on version 2.2.0 or higher use the unified fee structure.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
**Existing Coins**: Coins deployed before version 2.2.0 continue to use their original fee structure unless the coin owner migrates their liquidity to a 2.2.0+ hook. Migration to newer hooks adopts the new unified fee structure automatically.

For information on liquidity migration, see [Liquidity Migration](/coins/contracts/liquidity-migration).

### Multi-Hop Currency Conversion

All market rewards are automatically converted to the final backing currency before distribution:

#### Currency Hierarchy
- **Content Coins** are paired with **Creator Coins** (configured during [deployment](/coins/contracts/creating-a-coin#content-coin-configurable-currency))
- **Creator Coins** are paired with **ZORA** (configured during [deployment](/coins/contracts/creating-a-coin#creator-coin-zora-paired))

#### Conversion Process

When fees are collected, the hook automatically performs multi-hop swaps to reach the final payout currency:

1. **Content Coin fees** → **Creator Coin** (first hop)
2. **Creator Coin** → **ZORA** (second hop)

This ensures that all stakeholders receive rewards in **ZORA**, regardless of which coin type generated the fees.

#### Example Flow

```
Content Coin Trading → Fees Collected → Multi-hop Swap → All Recipients Receive ZORA
                   ↓
            Content Coin → Creator Coin → ZORA
```

### Key V4 Features

- **Automated Distribution**: Rewards are distributed on every single swap, no manual claiming required
- **Multi-Hop Conversion**: Automatically converts rewards through intermediate tokens to reach ZORA
- **Unified Currency**: All recipients receive rewards in the same target currency (ZORA)
- **Liquidity Preservation**: 20% of fees remain in pools as permanent liquidity


## Coin Rewards Terminology

**Trade Referral**: The platform or address that referred a specific trade/swap of a coin. In V4, this is passed through hook data and can trigger referral rewards.

**Platform Referral**: The platform that referred the creator to deploy the coin. This is set at coin creation time and earns a percentage of all trading fees. (Previously called "Create Referral" in versions prior to 2.2.0)

**Creator/Payout Recipient**: The address designated to receive creator rewards from trading activity. This can be updated by coin owners.

**Protocol**: The Zora protocol treasury that receives a portion of trading fees.

**Doppler**: The Doppler protocol treasury that receives a portion of trading fees.

## How It Works: Creator

1. Creator selects coin creation parameters including payout recipient
2. Creator specifies a wallet address eligible to claim their rewards
3. Creator launches their coin -- **that's it!**

The creator's total rewards are automatically distributed with each trade:
- **V4**: Converted to target currency and sent directly to payout recipient
- **V3**: Accumulated in escrow and can be withdrawn at any time

## How It Works: Developer

### Platform Referral Reward

The Platform Referral Reward is paid out to the developer or platform that referred the creator to deploy their coin using Zora's contracts.

#### Creating a Coin with Rewards

The `platformReferrer` address is specified upon coin creation through the factory's deploy function.

```solidity
function deploy(
    address payoutRecipient,
    address[] memory owners,
    string memory uri,
    string memory name,
    string memory symbol,
    bytes memory poolConfig,
    address platformReferrer, // This is the platform referral
    address postDeployHook,
    bytes calldata postDeployHookData,
    bytes32 coinSalt
) external payable returns (address coin, bytes memory postDeployHookDataOut);
```

### Trade Referral Reward

The Trade Referral Reward is paid out to the platform that referred a specific trade.

#### Trading with Referrals

Trade referrals are passed through the hook data when executing swaps via the Universal Router or other compatible interfaces.
